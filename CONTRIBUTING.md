*if you do not care about narratives just jump to ‘the solution’*

Background
===

There are three types of open source projects:

 - Libraries/tools developed commercially which are open sourced to get help and/or goodwill from the community. These libraries/tools often tend to be big and the amount of community input can be minimal.
 - Trivial libraries/tools that anybody can make and are shared publicly as a common courtesy. These are often developed whilst working for companies, but are too small and trivial for the company to care about or to be monetizable.
 - Big libraries/tools developed in programmers free time. 

Now, let's get the first and second case out of the way: In the first case companies will often release the project under a super free license because that aligns with their goals: getting as much contributions and goodwill as possible from the community. The only relatively rare exception here is if the product is available for commercial use under a different (for example JetBrains IntelliJ). The second case will also result in super free licenses often, because if it’s not free enough somebody else will simply make another version that *is* free enough.

The third case is where it gets hard. Whereas the reasoning for open sourcing a product is clear in the first two cases in the last case it differs a lot more. Personally I want others to enjoy my work and if it’s used non-commercially I wish you the best of wishes with it. It’s when a programmer gets paid by a company for work that I did in my free time that I feel somewhat more hesitant. It’s not that I do not want others to use my projects, but I do think it’s fair that if you as a programmer get paid for your time and this saves you time that at least a bit will trickle down to me.

The solution
===
I release my bigger projects under a GPL license. This means that consumers of these projects will have to contribute back to the community by making their projects open source as well. However, I will also offer the option that for any donation - be it big or small - I will grant them the right to use the project without this restriction. Once I am not the single largest contributor I will either relicense as LGPL or change the donations to a charity. So, to make this possible I need *contributors to grant me a generic right to relicense their contributions under any license and the discretion to license the project as a whole to any parties under those licenses*. I need this to be able to grant companies the right to use it commercially or to be able to change the license to LGPL once anybody makes a big enough contribution to warrant this.

Legal stuff
===
So, for me this isn’t really about earning money and believe me, it’s not earning me a lot of money either… so I am not going to hire a lawyer to write me up nice contracts and licenses and all that. Practically that means that there will no-doubt be holes in this construction ‘evil’ parties could misuse, but honestly, this might be naive, but I will just be upfront about my intentions and requirements and I will trust the goodwill of everybody who explicitly agrees to this construction.
