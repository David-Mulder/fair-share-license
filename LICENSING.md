So, the project you just linked from was released under a [GPL license](https://github.com/David-Mulder/fair-share-license/blob/master/GPL.txt). This practically means you can only use the project if you contribute your work to the open source community as well. If you can’t contribute back to the community in that way the project also offers the following alternative: think about how much time the project saves you compared to the next best alternative, next translate that time into money and try convincing your boss to donate any smaller amount of money and in return we will grant you the right to use the project under a generic software license. Whether you donate $0.01 or a thousand euros, in all cases you’re allowed to use the project commercially, so this isn’t so much about earning money as it’s just about it feeling a bit unfair if others profit from such work financially and the developer not earning a single cent from it.
